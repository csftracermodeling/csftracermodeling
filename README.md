# Requirements

## For data processing

- FreeSurfer needs to be installed
- the conda environment `diffusion-fenics-env` needs to be installed (see below)
- The following folders/files are needed and can be obtained from https://github.com/bzapf/rawdata and should be put into the top level under `/data/` in your cloned reposity as:
```
├──data
    ├──freesurfer
        ├── PREREG
        |   ├── 20220230_070707.mgz
        |   ├── 20220230_080808.mgz
        |   ├── ...
        ├── mri
        │   ├── aseg.mgz
```

## For inverse problems (PINN and FEM)

Assumes that MRI have been processed and concentration estimates computed. Also a mesh is assumed and a ROI.
Alternatively, this data can be obtained from https://github.com/bzapf/concentrationdata
and should be put into the top level in your cloned reposity under `/data/` as:
```
├──data
    ├──freesurfer
        ├── CONCENTRATIONS
        |   ├── 0.00.mgz
        |   ├── 06.25.mgz
        |   ├── ...
        ├── mri
        │   ├── parenchyma_mask.mgz
        ├── meshes
        │   ├── lh.xml
├──roi12
    ├──parenchyma_mask_roi.mgz
    ├──parenchyma_mask_boundary.mgz
    ├──parenchyma_mask_roi12.xml
```

# Setup

For FEniCS scripts and data processing, run in terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bzapf/tracerdiffusion.git
cd tracerdiffusion
conda env create -f fenics-env.yml
conda activate diffusion-fenics-env
python3 -m pip install -e .
export WORKDIR=./data/freesurfer/
```

For jax/PINNs scripts, run in terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bzapf/tracerdiffusion.git
cd tracerdiffusion
conda env create -f jax.yml
conda activate jax
python3 -m pip install -e .
```
